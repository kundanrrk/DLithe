                programming language to write operating system. The main features of C language include ow-level 
                access to memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable 
                for system programming like operating system or compiler development.

        <h1>Java</h1>
            <p>
                Java has been one of the most popular programming language for many years. Java is Object
                Oriented. However it is not considered as pure object oriented as it provides support for primitive
                data types (like int, char, etc). The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine independent 
                code). Then the byte code is run on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.
